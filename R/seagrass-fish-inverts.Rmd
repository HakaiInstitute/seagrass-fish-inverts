# Seagrass Fish and Inverts Data Package
## Purpose
This script serves to collect, aggregate, and QC fish and macroinvertebrate
survey data from the Hakai Nearshore Seagrass project.


## Setup - packages
This script will use multiple data packages, and source scripts. If you do not
already have the necessary data packages installed, please install them at this
point using `install.packages("PACKAGE_NAME")` in the console window.
```{r setup, include = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)
library(lubridate)

# load data
fish <- read.csv("../raw-data/seagrass_fish.csv")
inverts <- read.csv("../raw-data/seagrass_inverts.csv")
events <- read.csv("../raw-data/seagrass_events.csv")
```

## Data Quality Check

###Cross Reference Events
In order to ensure completeness of the fish and invertebrate datasets (i.e. all
site visits are included), the data will be aggregated to the event level, and
then cross referenced with the events data also loaded from the EIMS Portal. If
all data are present, the fish and invertebrate events should match the Events
table.

For each event (i.e.. transect - site_id - level visit), there should be two
fish surveys, and two invertebrate surveys. 

```{r event-qc}
# aggregate fish to event level
fish_events <-
  fish %>%
  group_by(date, survey, site_id, collector, collected_start) %>%
  summarise(n_species_obs = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(date, survey, site_id) %>%
  summarise(n_fish_surveys = n())

# aggregate inverts to event level
inverts_events <-
  inverts %>%
  group_by(date, survey, site_id, collector, collected_start) %>%
  summarise(n_species_obs = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(date, survey, site_id) %>%
  summarise(n_inverts_surveys = n())

# clean and aggregate events
events_count <-
  events %>%
  group_by(date, survey, site_id) %>%
  summarise(n_events = n())  # 

# join fish events with events; there should be two fish surveys for each event
fish_events_check <-
  right_join(fish_events, events_count) %>%
   # remove typo Koeye events still stuck in data portal
  filter(!grepl("KOEYE_ESTUARY_ESTUARY", survey),
         !grepl("KOEYE_ESTUARY ESTUARY", survey),
         !grepl("^KOEYE_KOEYE.*", site_id))

# join invert events with events; there should be two invert surveys for each event
inverts_events_check <-
  right_join(inverts_events, events_count) %>%
   # remove typo Koeye events still stuck in data portal
  filter(!grepl("KOEYE_ESTUARY_ESTUARY", survey),
         !grepl("KOEYE_ESTUARY ESTUARY", survey),
         !grepl("^KOEYE_KOEYE.*", site_id))

                           n_fish_surveys > 2 ~ "too many surveys")) %>%
## 2015 data not in the data portal currently
  filter(year(date) != 2015) %>%

### Checking for suspicious values

Check fish lengths and abundances for suspicious values, using Q-Q plots to look at data values vs. quantiles:
```{r}
#create qqplot
fishlengths_qqplot <- fish %>%
  ggplot(aes(col = species)) + 
  stat_qq(aes(sample = length_cm)) + 
  stat_qq_line(aes(sample = length_cm)) + 
  facet_wrap( ~ species) + 
  theme_classic() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")

#take a closer look at qqplots that look a little fishy (hah)
#code to pull up smaller subset of qqplots 

#filter out suspicious-looking lengths
# fishQC_length_cm <- fish %>%
#   filter(species == "sole/english" & length_cm > 25 |
#            species == "gunnel/crescent" & length_cm < 25)

```
