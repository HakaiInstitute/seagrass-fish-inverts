Table,Variable Name,Units or Categories,Description
"fish, inverts",organization,categorical,organization by which data were collected
"fish, inverts",work_area,categorical,larger region within which data were collected 
"fish, inverts",project,categorical,umbrella project under which data were collected
"fish, inverts",survey,categorical,local site location at which data were collected
"fish, inverts",site_id,categorical,transect location from which data were collected
"fish, inverts",date,yyyy-mm-dd,date on which data were collected
"fish, inverts",sampling_bout,numeric,"sample iteration; when multiple of the same sample type were collected on the same day at the same survey location, bout number will increase incrementally"
"fish, inverts",dive_supervisor,"categorical, names",technician(s) that served as dive supervisor(s) during data collection
"fish, inverts",collector,"categorical, names",technician that performed data collection
"fish, inverts",hakai_id,5 digit numeric,"unique identifying number for bulk field sample - this number generally identifies a seagrass shoot, as well as all the diatoms, mesograzers, and epiphytes that will later become separate samples; in the absence of a physical field sample, the hakai ID is autogenerated based on metadata from the observation"
"fish, inverts",sample_type,categorical,"identifies between different survey types (ie. seagrass_habitat, seagrass_density, fish, invertebrates)"
"fish, inverts",collected_start,yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss,local time at which observations began for given sampling instance
"fish, inverts",collected_end,yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss,local time at which observations finished for given sampling instance
"fish, inverts",species,categorical,taxonomic species observed
"fish, inverts",quantity,numeric,number of individuals in observation
fish,length_cm,numeric,length of individual(s) in observation in centimetres
inverts,size_cm,numeric,length of individual(s) in observation in centimetres
fish,estimated_quantity,categorical,indicates whether the quantity recorded is an estimate
"fish, inverts",quality_log,character,comments pertaining to the QC status of the data
fish,qc_flag_lengths,categorical,"informative labels for fish length data, based on Hakai Quality Flags: AV (within mean ± 2 standard deviations), SVC (within mean ± 2.5 standard deviations), SVD (not within mean ± 2.5 standard deviations)"
inverts,qc_flag_sizes,categorical,"informative labels for invertebrate size data, based on Hakai Quality Flags: AV (within mean ± 2 standard deviations), SVC (within mean ± 2.5 standard deviations), SVD (not within mean ± 2.5 standard deviations)"
"fish, inverts",qc_flag_abunds,categorical,"informative labels for fish and invertebrate abundances (quantity grouped by species and transect) , based on Hakai Quality Flags: AV (within mean ± 2 standard deviations), SVC (within mean ± 2.5 standard deviations), SVD (not within mean ± 2.5 standard deviations)"
