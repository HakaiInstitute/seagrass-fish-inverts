# Data Quality Control Log
All notable data quality control measures will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [v1.1.0] - 2023-01-12
### Notes ###
- Added 2022 data to existing dataset
### Tasks ###
- Same QC checks, corrections, and quality flags as in previous version

## [v1.0.0] - 2022-06-23
### Notes ###
- This is a first attempt at keeping a data QC log in this format. 
### Tasks ###
- Checked completeness of fish and invertebrate datasets by aggregating data to event level and cross-referencing with events loaded from EIMS Hakai Data Portal to ensure that all site visits were included (note that for each event there should be two fish surveys and two invertebrate surveys, with the exception of Goose SouthEast, McMullin South, and Triquet North sites, where there should be zero fish and zero invertebrate surveys for 2018 onwards)
- Corrected all instances in both fish and invertebrate data where multiple names were used to refer to the same thing for `species`, `surveyor`, and `dive_supervisor`
- Corrected various misspellings in both fish and invertebrate data 
- Converted all blank cells to NA and removed columns with all NA data
- Corrected "2012" to "2016" in `collected_start` and `collected_end` variables in fish data
- Corrected missing diver names
- Corrected "size_cm" for all siphonophores in invertebrate data to NA
- Corrected discrepancies between `date` and `collected_start`/`collected_end` variables 
- Appended Hakai Quality Flag variable for lengths/sizes and abundances for both fish and invertebrate datasets, as follows:
	- AV (Accepted Value) for all values within the mean +/- 2 standard deviations (95% of data)
	- SVC (Suspicious value - caution) for all values within the mean +/- 2.5 standard deviations (99% of data), not including values already deemed AV
	- SVD (Suspicious value - reject) for all other values
