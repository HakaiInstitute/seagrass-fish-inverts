# Data Quality Control Log
All notable data quality control measures will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). 

## [v1.0.0] - 2020-07-[release date]
### Notes ###
- This is a first attempt at keeping a data QC log in this format. 

### Tasks ###
- *consider adding column to data spreadsheet to keep track of who quality checked what (suggested in Hakai Nearshore Data Standards and Best Practices guideslines)

- Checked completeness of fish and invertebrate datasets by aggregating data to event level and cross-referencing with events loaded from EIMS portal to ensure that all site visits were included (note that for each event there should be two fish surveys and two invertebrate surveys with the exception of Goose SouthEast, McMullin, and Triquet sites, where there should be zero fish and zero invertebrate surveys for dates 2018 onwards)
- Fixed all instances in both fish and invertebrate datasets where multiple names were used to refer to the same thing for "species", "collector", and "dive_supervisor"
- Corrected misspelling of "melibe" in fish dataset
- Corrected all siphonophores in invertebrate dataset to having NA for "size_cm" variable 
- Appended Hakai Quality Flag variable for lengths/sizes and abundances for both fish and invertebrate datasets, as follows:
	- AV (Accepted Value) for all values within the mean +/- 2 standard deviations (95% of data)
	- SVC (Suspicious value - caution) for all values within the mean +/- 2.5 standard deviations (99% of data), not including values already deemed AV
	- SVD (Suspicious value - reject) for all other values
